note: I think the book is vastly oversimplifying here to make it comprehensible to people with little background (since at this point in the book, MHC has not been introduced yet). But looking at Wikipedia, it seems that what positive selection actually does is to make sure the T cell can bind to MHC (the hot dog bun), so that it can even have a shot at binding to antigens. If a helper T cell can't even bind to the hot dog bun, then there's no shot it can eat wieners of any kind, so would be quite a useless T cell.<br><br>source: Philipp Dettmer.

What makes treating viral infections challenging compared to bacterial infections?
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="back">
Viruses use the body's own proteins to gain access to cells and "hide out" in the cells. Inhibiting viruses would thus involve damage to the body's own proteins or cells.
</div>
<div class="notes">
Also viruses aren't "complete" on their own so they make use of the body's own protein production machinery, so attacking protein production would mean attacking your own cells.<br><br>Also the idea that viruses try to be very similar to your body's proteins so as to gain access to cells, so it's difficult to make drugs that exploit a difference between the shapes of viruses vs your body's cells.<br><br>(this card should probably be split to ask for all the different possible answers)<br><br>source: Philipp Dettmer.
