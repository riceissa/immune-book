  <p>Philipp Dettmer’s <i>Immune: A Journey into the Mysterious System That
    Keeps You Alive</i> gives an excellent introduction to immunology.

  writing is just simple enough that it allows the reader to interrogate possibilities for ; you're given a bunch of lego blocks and allows you to connect those blocks yourself and make new things, ask new questions. allows the reader to have a mechanistic understanding of immunology. while also being honest about exceptions. wherever it can be simple, it tries to be simple.

  has a lot of terminology. And the terms are relevant for understanding the later chapters; this means having a solid grasp of the earlier chapters helps to understand the later chapters.
  should be read incrementally.
  it's a book that has a LOT of details, and these details should just be read once and forgotten. it's worth remembering a good fraction of the details.</p>


  <p>our cards:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>we’re faithful to the description of the term as per the book, don’t
      try to embellish or reword. we try to stick to the analogies given in
      the book for the most part.</li>
    <li>our cards have a variety of types: definitional, visuals, analogies,
      why it matters, sequence of immune action/temporal component.</li>
    <li>not too long. each answer is no more than a sentence or two.</li>
  </ul>



  <p>Because the <i>Immune</i> book is copyrighted, you will have to bring your own copy of the
  book. But assuming you have a copy, you can collect the cards on this website
  as you read along. Start at the very beginning of the book. Read one chapter at
  a time (make sure to read the entire chapter <em>including any asides</em>), and each time you finish a chapter, come to this site (or go to Anki,
  if you chose to download the deck) and review the
  cards corresponding to that chapter.  In this way, you have a read → review
  loop that will help you to internalize the material better as you read it
  for the first time. And because these are flashcards plugged into a spaced
  repetition system, you will also be able to retain your knowledge
  long-term!</p>

    <h3>There are three ways to use this website:</h3>

      <div class="use-option-button-container">
        <a class="use-option-button" href="https://riceissa.github.io/immune-book/immune.apkg">&darr; Download Anki deck</a>
        <p>If you already use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>
        and want to review these flashcards in Anki, this option is for you.
        Just download the file and then go to Anki and click “Import File”
        or do File → Import&hellip; from the menu bar.
        The Anki deck features randomly changing
        typefaces and font sizes to prevent pattern-matching on the
        appearance of the cards (this can be disabled by editing the card
        template).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="use-option-button-container">
        <a class="use-option-button" href="orbit/"> Review cards using Orbit</a>
        <p>If you don’t already use Anki and don’t want to install it on your
        computer, you can review the cards using <a href="https://withorbit.com/">Orbit</a>, a browser-based spaced
        repetition system. Review reminders will come in via email. (We won’t
        have access to your email address, although the person running Orbit
        will.)</p>

      <div class="use-option-button-container">
        <a class="use-option-button"  href="browse/">Show me the cards</a>
        <p>If you just want to look through all the cards to see what they look
        like, you can pick this option.  If you use a spaced repetition sytem
        other than Anki or Orbit, you can also go through this page
        and pick and choose which cards you want to add.</p>
