    <h1><i>Gödel, Escher, Bach</i> Typogenetics/DNA/RNA Flashcards</h1>

  <h2>A way to remember what you have learned</h2>

  <hr class="squiggle" />

  <p>Buried deep within the 700+ pages of Douglas Hofstadter’s
  <i>Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</i> (GEB) is an excellent
  standalone introductory exposition of DNA and RNA (that is, basic
  molecular genetics) using a simplified system he calls Typogenetics.
  In our view, it’s a great way to learn about this topic for people
  with a background in computer science or mathematics,
  and does not require reading any of the earlier parts of the book.
  We want to raise this part of the book to people’s attention, so we
  made this website.
  This website provides digital flashcards for
  this portion of the book, which will help you better internalize and retain
  the material.  Specifically, it covers Chapter XVI: Self-Ref and
  Self-Rep, pp.&nbsp;504–532.</p>

  <p>Because GEB is copyrighted, you will have to bring your own copy of the
  book. But assuming you have a copy, you can collect the cards on this website
  as you read along. Go to page 504 in GEB (starting at the section heading
  “Typogenetics”). Read one section at
  a time, and each time you finish a section, come to this site (or go to Anki,
  if you chose to download the deck) and review the
  cards corresponding to that section.  In this way, you have a read → review
  loop that will help you to internalize the material better as you read it
  for the first time. And because these are flashcards plugged into a spaced
  repetition system, you will also be able to retain your knowledge
  long-term!</p>

  <div class="use-options-container">
    <h3>There are three ways to use this website:</h3>

      <div class="use-option-button-container">
        <a class="use-option-button" href="https://riceissa.github.io/geb-typogenetics-dna-rna/geb-typogenetics.apkg">&darr; Download Anki deck</a>
        <p>If you already use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>
        and want to review these flashcards in Anki, this option is for you.
        Just download the file and then go to Anki and click “Import File”
        or do File → Import&hellip; from the menu bar.
        The Anki deck features randomly changing
        typefaces and font sizes to prevent pattern-matching on the
        appearance of the cards (this can be disabled by editing the card
        template).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="use-option-button-container">
        <a class="use-option-button" href="orbit/"> Review cards using Orbit</a>
        <p>If you don’t already use Anki and don’t want to install it on your
        computer, you can review the cards using <a href="https://withorbit.com/">Orbit</a>, a browser-based spaced
        repetition system. Review reminders will come in via email. (We won’t
        have access to your email address, although the person running Orbit
        will.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="use-option-button-container">
        <a class="use-option-button"  href="browse/">Show me the cards</a>
        <p>If you just want to look through all the cards to see what they look
        like, you can pick this option.  If you use a spaced repetition sytem
        other than Anki or Orbit, you can also go through this page
        and pick and choose which cards you want to add.</p>
