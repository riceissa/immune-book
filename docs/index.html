    <h1><i>Immune</i> Book Flashcards</h1>

  <h2>A way to remember what you have learned</h2>

  <hr class="squiggle" />

  <p>blah</p>

  <p>Because the <i>Immune</i> book is copyrighted, you will have to bring your own copy of the
  book. But assuming you have a copy, you can collect the cards on this website
  as you read along. Start at the very beginning of the book. Read one chapter at
  a time, and each time you finish a chapter, come to this site (or go to Anki,
  if you chose to download the deck) and review the
  cards corresponding to that chapter.  In this way, you have a read → review
  loop that will help you to internalize the material better as you read it
  for the first time. And because these are flashcards plugged into a spaced
  repetition system, you will also be able to retain your knowledge
  long-term!</p>

  <div class="use-options-container">
    <h3>There are three ways to use this website:</h3>

      <div class="use-option-button-container">
        <a class="use-option-button" href="https://riceissa.github.io/immune-book/TODO.apkg">&darr; Download Anki deck</a>
        <p>If you already use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>
        and want to review these flashcards in Anki, this option is for you.
        Just download the file and then go to Anki and click “Import File”
        or do File → Import&hellip; from the menu bar.
        The Anki deck features randomly changing
        typefaces and font sizes to prevent pattern-matching on the
        appearance of the cards (this can be disabled by editing the card
        template).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="use-option-button-container">
        <a class="use-option-button" href="orbit/"> Review cards using Orbit</a>
        <p>If you don’t already use Anki and don’t want to install it on your
        computer, you can review the cards using <a href="https://withorbit.com/">Orbit</a>, a browser-based spaced
        repetition system. Review reminders will come in via email. (We won’t
        have access to your email address, although the person running Orbit
        will.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="use-option-button-container">
        <a class="use-option-button"  href="browse/">Show me the cards</a>
        <p>If you just want to look through all the cards to see what they look
        like, you can pick this option.  If you use a spaced repetition sytem
        other than Anki or Orbit, you can also go through this page
        and pick and choose which cards you want to add.</p>
