Fun fact: Variolation comes from the term variola, which is another term for small pox

                          answer="1\) **Passive**: Giving someone antibodies against a pathogen, where those antibodies were created in a different organism  
2) **Delivering a diluted form of a pathogen**: Giving someone a diluted form of a pathogen to not overwhelm the capacity of the person to fight the pathogen while still having enough concentration of pathogen as to develop Memory B and T cells  
3) **Subunit**: Giving someone only part of the antigen that will bind to B and T cells  
4) **mRNA**: Giving someone mRNA fragments which when transcribed, create an antigen mimicking a relevant part of the pathogen, that the body will create Memory B and T cells against

note: The book was kind of vague about whether it always fails the second time, or whether it's just less effective.
