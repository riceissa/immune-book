                          answer="central

Essentially, as stated in previous places in the book, the immune system needs constant stimulation to stay active, so the default course of action is to shut down activity over time, and this is why only local info is needed to implement the shutdown. The only part that's slightly ambiguous is the regulatory cells which seem to be slightly central-authority-ish.

                          answer="1\) they can order Dendritic Cells to become worse at activating the Adaptive Immune System  
2) they can make Helper T Cells slow and tired, so they don’t proliferate as much  
3) they can turn Killer T Cells into much less vicious fighters, shut down inflammation, and make it recede faster

                          answer="the gut

note: It's possible regulatory T cells are important in other places as well, like maybe the lungs, where you need a concerted effort from the regulatory T cells as well as the supposedly inflammation-dampening alveolar macrophages, but the book didn't mention these things.

                          answer="due to the need to keep around commensal bacteria without your immune system killing them

note: At one point, I wanted to answer &quot;because you don't want inflammation/too much fluid in your gut&quot; for this card. But regulatory T cells don't directly reduce inflammation; they act on other T cells, not directly on macrophages/neutrophils (which are the main cells that cause inflammation).
