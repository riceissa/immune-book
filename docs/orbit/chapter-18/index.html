                          answer="a test to make sure T cells can recognize the other immune cells they will be working with / to make sure they can recognize and bind to MHC

note: I think the book is vastly oversimplifying here to make it comprehensible to people with little background (since at this point in the book, MHC has not been introduced yet). But looking at Wikipedia, it seems that what positive selection actually does is to make sure the T cell can bind to MHC (the hot dog bun), so that it can even have a shot at binding to antigens. If a helper T cell can't even bind to the hot dog bun, then there's no shot it can eat wieners of any kind, so would be quite a useless T cell.

The tonsils do their crucial work when you are a child, so much so that they can be removed sometimes without complication; the thymus keeps shrinking and withering away as you age (although perhaps it is still crucial/important even in old age)
