&quot;And mucus is not just a sticky barrier but also filled with unpleasant surprises similar to the desert kingdom \[i.e. the skin\]: salts, weaponized enzymes that can dissolve the outsides of microbes, and special substances that sort of sponge up crucial nutrients that bacteria need to survive, so they starve to death inside the mucus&quot; (Chapter 24)

&quot;To catch these serious enemies as early as possible, your gut has a type of special lymph node called Peyer’s patches that are directly integrated into your intestines. Microfold Cells (the same cells that we briefly met in your tonsils) reach directly into the intestines and take samples of things they think might be interesting for the immune system to take a look at.&quot;
