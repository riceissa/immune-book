                          answer="Both (innate and adaptive)! (B cells require two-factor authentication)

The innate activation is passive, and happens via complement proteins being attached to dead pathogens coming in via lymph fluid. (From the book: &quot;B Cells do have more direct help from the Innate Immune System. Did you think it was suspicious that we kept mentioning that the bacteria from the battlefield were covered in complement proteins? B Cells cannot just recognize the dead bacteria antigens, they also have special receptors that are able to recognize complement proteins.&quot;)  
  
The adaptive activation happens via helper T cells.

                          answer="Just one

note: In reality things are a bit more complicated. The book later goes on to say that T and B cells can actually recognize several antigens, but that it's very good at recognizing one of them.

                          answer="Antibodies are stuck to the surface of B cells and work as their receptors, but once a B cell is activated tons of new antibodies are created and released so they can attack your enemies

However, as far as I know, the antibodies that are on the surface of B cells do not detach to start attacking antigens. They're the same as the antibodies that attack, but they're just stuck on the surface acting as receptors. But perhaps I'm wrong about that.

                          answer="1\. B cells can present many different antigens at once on their surface whereas dendritic cells don't  
  
2. Dendritic cells travel all the way from the battlefield to a lymph node to do the presentation, whereas B cells just pick up antigens in the lymph node and then just do the presentation there(?)  
  
3. Dendritic cells are the ones that kiss the helper T cell, whereas in the B cell case, it's the helper T cell that does the kissing

note: This is going off the book's descriptions of each antigen presentation. But it's possible that dendritic cells also present lots of antigens all over their body, at least some of the time.
