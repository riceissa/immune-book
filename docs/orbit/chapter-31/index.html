                          answer="Virus leaking, Virus containing

&quot;It is very important how an infected cell kills itself. If the T Cell, for example, used just chemical weapons and threw them around, like the way Neutrophils do it, they would rip their victim open and make them burst. Not only would this release the cell’s guts and insides and cause harsh inflammation reactions, it would also release all the viruses inside the infected cell that have been made until this point.&quot;
