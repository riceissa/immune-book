                          answer="The helper T cells aren't actually *rating* the B cell's receptors

The helper T cells will happily encourage any B cell as long as the B cell presents an antigen that fits the helper T cell at all. The real selection step is actually happening when the B cell tries to grab antigens – the better it is at grabbing antigens, the more likely it will actually grab one and be able to present it to the helper T cell

                          answer="The B cells are doing this to themselves when they try to pick up the antigens (the B cells with better-matching receptors will be able to pick up antigens better)

note: I had a misconception initially that the helper T cells were the ones &quot;rating&quot; the B cell receptor shapes. But the helper T cells just look for whether any antigen at all is presented to them, and they don't seem to care if it's a &quot;better&quot; antigen or a better receptor for the antigen – it's the same antigen every time, as far as I know.

                          answer="The B cells aren't finding out that the guests like the recipe more – the guests are insensitive to the antigen that's presented! Instead, the B cells are finding out *whether they can cook a dish at all* (or maybe more precisely, how quickly they can cook a dish or how many dishes they can cook, neither of which depends on the guests' preferences)
