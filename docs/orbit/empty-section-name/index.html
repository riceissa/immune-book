\[question\] is this really true? i know helper T cells are one part of it. but i thought B cells just recognize the floating antigens? does the book mean complement proteins aid in that process? i don't think dendritic cells are involved. so i'm confused where the &quot;innate&quot; part is coming from.

                          answer="Viruses use the body's own proteins to gain access to cells and &quot;hide out&quot; in the cells. Inhibiting viruses would thus involve damage to the body's own proteins or cells.

Also viruses aren't &quot;complete&quot; on their own so they make use of the body's own protein production machinery, so attacking protein production would mean attacking your own cells.  
  
Also the idea that viruses try to be very similar to your body's proteins so as to gain access to cells, so it's difficult to make drugs that exploit a difference between the shapes of viruses vs your body's cells.
