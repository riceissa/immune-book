                          answer="Example answers:  
  
- Skin cells are stacked many layers, whereas epithelial cells generally aren't (although there are exceptions)  
  
- Epithelial skin cells contain hair follicles whereas epithelial mucosal cells contain cilia

&quot;For example, the oral epithelium is generally thicker compared to skin, as both palate and buccal mucosa consist of considerably more cell layers and a higher proliferation rate in the basal lamina compared to skin (20–30 versus 5–8 living cell layers, respectively)&quot; from [The Bigger Picture: Why Oral Mucosa Heals Better Than Skin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8394648/).

                          answer="The epithelial layer

Note: Even though mucus is on top of the epithelial layer, the mucus is not actually considered part of the mucosa, but rather considered to be secreted by the mucosa. &quot;The mucosa is composed of one or more layers of epithelial cells that secrete mucus, and an underlying lamina propria of loose connective tissue. The type of cells and type of mucus secreted vary from organ to organ and each can differ along a given tract.&quot; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane#Structure>  
  
So in order to match up with the book's description better, I decided to use the term &quot;mucosal barrier&quot; which includes the mucus layer. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_mucosal_barrier>
