                          answer="HIV is not immediately lethal to cells

&quot;HIV also can lie dormant and do nothing in cells for long periods of time waiting for the right time to become active. When a cell does not multiply, its protein production is in a sort of slow mode, aimed only at sustaining the cell—but when a cell proliferates, these production machineries amplify thousandfolds.&quot;

&quot;The genetic code of HIV is extremely prone to copying  
errors—on average, every time the virus makes a copy of itself it makes an error. Which means even in a single cell there are numerous different variants of HIV&quot;

&quot;It is easy to forget that HIV used to be a new pandemic once and a very shocking and scary one. In 2019 there were still around thirty-eight million infected people around the world. When HIV and AIDS emerged it caused panic in the establishment, leading to an outpouring of resources and attention that was unprecedented.&quot;
