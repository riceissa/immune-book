note: I think the book is saying that your MHC can efficiently bind *some*Â self-antigen, not that it can generically bind to all of your body's antigens efficiently

note: this is very similar to the idea the book mentioned in the aside about why there aren't better antiviral drugs: viruses are too similar to the host's own proteins
