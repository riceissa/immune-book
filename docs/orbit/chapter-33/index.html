                          answer="Viruses use the body's own proteins to gain access to cells and &quot;hide out&quot; in the cells. Inhibiting the entry of viruses into cells would thus potentially inhibit normal cell communication.

                          answer="The evolutionary strategy of viruses is to try to be very similar to your body's proteins so as to gain access to cells, so it's difficult to make drugs that exploit a difference between the shapes of viruses vs your body's cells.

From Chapter 31: &quot;About ten days after you caught the infection in the break room you are still pretty sick. Your immune system has been fighting but it also made you feel horrible in the process and the infection is still going strong. Around this time, the Killer T Cells finally arrive in your infected lung.&quot;  
  
From Chapter 33: &quot;It takes about two to three days until Natural Killer Cells show up and begin to alleviate your desperately fighting immune soldiers.&quot;
